# SHAPE

---

## Introduction

This is fitness application made by me using ASP.NET Core MVC framework. It is designed to assist users in tracking their health and fitness goals.

## Features

- **BMI Calculation**: Users can input their weight and height, and the app calculates their BMI. Users have the option to choose between metric or imperial units.
- **Body Fat Calculation**: Users can input additional measurements such as waist circumference, neck circumference, and optionally hip circumference to estimate body fat percentage using various formulas and algorithms.
- **Diet Recommendations**: Based on the user's BMI, body fat percentage, and fitness goals, SHAPE provides personalized diet recommendations to help users achieve their desired health outcomes.
